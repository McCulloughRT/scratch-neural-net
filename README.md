# scratch-neural-net
A library for creating deep neural nets in pure python/numpy

This is a set of functions for building N-Layer neural nets in python using numpy. Compared to modern frameworks like Tensorflow, MXNet, etc... it is considerably slower and should not be used in a production application, however it can be useful for debuging deep learning architectures due to functions being evaluated imperatively instead of building a static (black-box) computation graph like Tensorflow.

I created this after completing the deep learning courses from deeplearning.ai, to implement and more fully understand the concepts of deep neural nets by creating them from scrath.
